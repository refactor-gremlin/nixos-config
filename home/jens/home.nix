      # CodeRabbit CLI (custom package) - DISABLED
      # The CodeRabbit binary is a Bun-based application that checks its execution context
      # to determine whether to run as CodeRabbit CLI or as generic Bun runtime.
      # 
      # Issues encountered:
      # 1. Manual patchelf: Causes "unsupported version 0 of Verdef record" errors and segfaults
      #    - The binary has complex ELF structures that manual patchelf can't handle properly
      # 2. autoPatchelfHook: Successfully patches the binary without crashes, but:
      #    - The binary always shows Bun help instead of CodeRabbit help
      #    - Tried exec -a "coderabbit" wrapper to set argv[0] - didn't work
      #    - Tried symlinks - didn't work
      #    - The binary appears to check something else (possibly /proc/self/exe, embedded
      #      resources, or environment variables) rather than just argv[0]
      # 3. The fresh binary works correctly when downloaded directly, but after Nix patching
      #    it loses the ability to detect it should run as CodeRabbit
      #
      # Possible solutions not yet tried:
      # - Use buildFHSUserEnv to run in a more traditional Linux environment
      # - Check if there are environment variables the binary expects
      # - Investigate if the binary has embedded resources that get corrupted during patching
      # - Use a different packaging approach (e.g., AppImage-style wrapper)
      #
      # For now, users can install CodeRabbit manually:
      #   curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | bash
      # inputs.self.packages.${system}.coderabbit
