# CodeRabbit CLI package
#
# This uses buildFHSUserEnv to run the binary in an FHS-compliant sandbox
# without patching it. The CodeRabbit binary (Bun-based) checks its execution
# context to determine whether to run as CodeRabbit CLI or as generic Bun runtime.
# Traditional Nix patchelf breaks this detection, causing it to always run as Bun.
#
# Solution: Use buildFHSUserEnv to create an environment that provides libraries
# at standard FHS paths while keeping the binary completely unmodified.
#
# Works by:
# 1. Extracting and installing the binary to a temporary location without patching
# 2. Creating an FHS sandbox environment with standard library paths
# 3. The wrapper script runs the binary inside the sandbox where it can detect
#    it should run as CodeRabbit based on its name/context
